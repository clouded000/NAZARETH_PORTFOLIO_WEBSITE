          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p class="pixel-copy">
            Hi! I’m <strong>Megan Villadelgado Nazareth</strong>, a third-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT)
            student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines – Quezon City Branch. I’m 20 years old, born on
            March 1, 2005, and I currently live in North Fairview, Quezon City.
          </p>

          <p class="pixel-copy">
            As a student, I’m deeply interested in exploring how technology can be used creatively to solve real-world
            problems and make everyday life easier. I enjoy learning new concepts, experimenting with different tools,
            and improving my skills through both academic and personal projects.
          </p>

          <p class="pixel-copy">
            Aside from my studies, I’m also an entrepreneur and the owner of <strong>Clouded Threads</strong>, a small business
            where I handcraft crochet trinkets. Crocheting allows me to express my creativity and patience, and it’s a
            relaxing way to bring something beautiful to life from just yarn and imagination.
          </p>

          <p class="pixel-copy">
            You might also come across the name “<strong>Kumo</strong>” — that’s my pseudonym, inspired by my love for clouds
            and the sky. “Kumo” reflects my creative side and reminds me to stay light, curious, and open to endless
            possibilities — whether in technology, art, or life.
          </p>
